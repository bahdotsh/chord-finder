Intro: [Bm] [F#] [A] [E] [G] [D] [Em] [F#]

[Bm] On a dark desert highway, [F#] cool wind in my hair
[A] Warm smell of colitas, [E] rising up through the air
[G] Up ahead in the distance, [D] I saw a shimmering light
[Em] My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
[F#] I had to stop for the night

[Bm] There she stood in the doorway; [F#] I heard the mission bell
[A] And I was thinking to myself, "This could be [E] Heaven or this could be Hell"
[G] Then she lit up a candle [D] and she showed me the way
[Em] There were voices down the corridor, [F#] I thought I heard them say...

[G] Welcome to the Hotel Cali[D]fornia
Such a [F#] lovely place (such a lovely place), such a [Bm] lovely face
[G] Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali[D]fornia
Any [Em] time of year (any time of year), you can [F#] find it here

[Bm] Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, [F#] she got the Mercedes bends
[A] She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, [E] that she calls friends
[G] How they dance in the courtyard, [D] sweet summer sweat
[Em] Some dance to remember, [F#] some dance to forget

[Bm] So I called up the Captain, [F#] "Please bring me my wine"
He said, [A] "We haven't had that spirit here since [E] nineteen sixty-nine"
[G] And still those voices are calling from [D] far away
[Em] Wake you up in the middle of the night, [F#] just to hear them say...

[G] Welcome to the Hotel Cali[D]fornia
Such a [F#] lovely place (such a lovely place), such a [Bm] lovely face
They [G] livin' it up at the Hotel Cali[D]fornia
What a [Em] nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your [F#] alibis
