[C] [Am] [C] [Am]

Now I've [C] heard there was a [Am] secret chord
That [C] David played, and it [Am] pleased the Lord
But [F] you don't really [G] care for music, [C] do you? [G]
It [C] goes like this, the [F] fourth, the [G] fifth
The [Am] minor falls, the [F] major lifts
The [G] baffled king com[E7]posing Halle[Am]lujah

Halle[F]lujah, Halle[Am]lujah
Halle[F]lujah, Halle[C]lu[G]jah [C] [G]

Your [C] faith was strong but you [Am] needed proof
You [C] saw her bathing [Am] on the roof
Her [F] beauty and the [G] moonlight over[C]threw you [G]
She [C] tied you to a [F] kitchen [G] chair
She [Am] broke your throne, and she [F] cut your hair
And [G] from your lips she [E7] drew the Halle[Am]lujah

Halle[F]lujah, Halle[Am]lujah
Halle[F]lujah, Halle[C]lu[G]jah [C] [G]

[C] Baby I have been [Am] here before
I [C] know this room, I've [Am] walked this floor
I [F] used to live a[G]lone before I [C] knew you [G]
I've [C] seen your flag on the [F] marble [G] arch
[Am] Love is not a [F] victory march
It's a [G] cold and it's a [E7] broken Halle[Am]lujah

Halle[F]lujah, Halle[Am]lujah
Halle[F]lujah, Halle[C]lu[G]jah [C] [G]

[C] Maybe there's a [Am] God above
But [C] all I've ever [Am] learned from love
Was [F] how to shoot at [G] someone who out[C]drew you [G]
It's [C] not a cry you [F] can [G] hear at night
It's [Am] not somebody who has [F] seen the light
It's a [G] cold and it's a [E7] broken Halle[Am]lujah

Halle[F]lujah, Halle[Am]lujah
Halle[F]lujah, Halle[C]lu[G]jah [C] [G]
