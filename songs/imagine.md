[C] [F] [C] [F]

[C] Imagine there's no [F] heaven
[C] It's easy if you [F] try
[C] No hell be[F]low us
[C] Above us only [F] sky
[F/C] Imagine [Am/C] all the [Dm] people [F]
[G] Living for to[G7]day, ah [C] ah [F] [C] [F]

[C] Imagine there's no [F] countries
[C] It isn't hard to [F] do
[C] Nothing to kill or [F] die for
[C] And no religion, [F] too
[F/C] Imagine [Am/C] all the [Dm] people [F]
[G] Living life in [G7] peace, you [C] oh [F] [C] [F]

[F] You may [G] say I'm a [C] dreamer [E7] [F]
But I'm [G] not the only [C] one [E7] [F]
I hope some [G] day you'll [C] join us [E7] [F]
And the [G] world will [C] be as one

[C] Imagine no pos[F]sessions
[C] I wonder if you [F] can
[C] No need for greed or [F] hunger
[C] A brotherhood of [F] man
[F/C] Imagine [Am/C] all the [Dm] people [F]
[G] Sharing all the [G7] world, you [C] oh [F] [C] [F]

[F] You may [G] say I'm a [C] dreamer [E7] [F]
But I'm [G] not the only [C] one [E7] [F]
I hope some [G] day you'll [C] join us [E7] [F]
And the [G] world will [C] live as one
